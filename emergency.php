        <h4>EMERGENCY RESPONSE</h4>
        <p>Millions of families in Pakistan are vulnerable to the climate crisis and many have already suffered repeated extreme weather events this year, from unrelenting heat waves to unusually heavy monsoon rains and flooding that has proved to be the deadliest in over a decade. Already reeling from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic downturns, families from floodaffected areas of Pakistan are forced to cope with hunger and uncertainty as monsoon rains, fed by glacial melt, continue to sweep across the country. 
Starting in mid-June 2022, heavy monsoon rainfall, 2.8 times higher than the national 30-year average, resulted in massive floods and widespread destruction across Pakistan. The climate catastrophe has already affected 116 districts in all provinces across the country, including Azad Jammu and Kashmir. At least 1,000 people have died and more than 1,400 are injured; over 3,000 km of roads and over 100 bridges have been damaged or destroyed; nearly 800,000 livestock have perished, and 2 million acres of crops and orchards have been impacted during the critical July - December harvest period for the rice and cotton ‘summer seasons’ crop. To assess the impact of floods in affected districts of Sindh TDP launched its entire human resource and started flood response on its own resources.
