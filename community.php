        <h4>THE COMMUNITY PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR (CPI)</h4>
        <p>Developed picture of community physical infra-structure is one of the prominent indicators of the socio economic prosperity of any community. Well developed countries & communities have wonderful physical infrastructure exhibiting their lavishness. 
Sindh province & especially rural area being marginalized are having innumerable infra-structure issues. Roads, house, water sources, bridges, culverts & other sources are not in the developed scale as comparatively are in other provinces of the Pakistan. 
 
 
Transparent Development Programme (TDP) has devised viable strategy to develop the physical infrastructure as per 
needs of the community. It has been seen that Poverty clubbed with ignorance is the major reason for dithering physical infra-structure in rural areas & one of main reason of deprivation & vulnerability. 
 
The CPI sector aims to addresses the issues of community infrastructure such as supplying pure drinking water, construction of link roads, brick streets, construction of culverts & other such activities in rural areas. The core function of CPI sector would be to provide basic infrastructure facilities in undeveloped areas. TDP a promising organization but having viable program for the provision off CPI facilities in rural areas on need based approach.
