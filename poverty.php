        <h3>Poverty Alleviation Sector (PAS)</h3>
        <p>Rampant poverty, lack of income generation sources, and unemployment have brought a sense of deprivation among the youth in Sindh province. This has left a gruesome impact on the socio-economic life of the common man. Keeping this in view, TDP has established the Poverty Alleviation Sector (PAS) to bring the community into the mainstream of economic development with viable sources of income generation.</p>
        <p>Poverty alleviation and bringing economic sustainability is one of the key activities that TDP is planning to undertake. The program is aimed at addressing the widespread poverty in our rural and urban areas. The sector will serve as a sustainable economic platform for TDP's target groups to establish their micro businesses or enterprises of their own choice. TDP is looking forward to collaborating with financial institutions and donors to implement a microcredit program in poverty-hit urban and rural areas. The salient features of the microcredit program are as follows:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Providing microcredit for standing enterprises or new initiatives.</li>
            <li>Developing the technical skills of entrepreneurs through comprehensive training.</li>
            <li>Extending vocational, livestock, and agro-based credit facilities to females to bring them into the economic mainstream.</li>
            <li>Imparting quality training on enterprise development for sustainable economic initiatives and long-duration activities.</li>
            <li>Orienting a sense of sustainability and income generation initiatives among girls and females.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Though TDP has not formally launched poverty alleviation activities, it is trying its best to initiate work on poverty alleviation. Currently, it is busy forming community groups on the issue.</p>
